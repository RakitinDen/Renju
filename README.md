# Renju Project

Made by Rakitin Denis, student of the Faculty of Computer Science of HSE. Group 162.

This is a repository for educational project called "Renju" (in fact, it's more about Gomoku), which aim is to build a model that would play 5-in-a-row on a high level.

Initially, as it was a "course work-like" project, we had to go deeper in machine learning. Educational tasks can be found at a folder "Labs".
Scripts used for training models can be found in IPython notebook train.ipynb. Data, used for training models, can be found [here].

# Prerequisites
1. UNIX-like OS. Program was launched only in Ubutnu 14 and 16 environment
2. Python 3.5 interpreter

# Instruction
Firstly, install pip3.
Using pip3, install following modules:
1. NumPy, TKinter
2. Tensorflow 1.8.0, Keras 2.1.6 and H5py

Download folder "Renju".
Launch command ./play.py

# Special
Of course, this all could not happen without our mentor [Denis Simagin], that did a great work, and made our time spent for project not just useful, but really interesting.
