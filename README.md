# Renju
This is a repository for educational project called "Renju" (in fact, it's more about Gomoku), which aim is to build a model that would play 5-in-a-row on a high level.

Initially, as it was a "course work-like" project, we had to go deeper in machine learning. Educational tasks can be found at a folder "Labs".

#Of course, this all could not happen without our mentor [Denis Simagin], that did a great work, and made our time spent for project not just useful, but really interesting.
